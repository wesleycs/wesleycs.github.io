            <p class="center" id="about"> I am a mover and a shaker - A generalist with a sweet spot for getting things done.
                I'm the kind of guy you can call and ask for an elephant and without hesitation I'll ask how many do you need and when.
                I have a degree in computer science and a brain built for moonshotting. I'm currently networking with my creative friends in Buffalo NY and
                working on video production projects and experimental technology experiences. I pride myself on my creative problem solving abilities that
                I gained from growing up working with farmers whose lives depended on getting things done when there wasn't a right answer.
                Above all I am an empathetic leader. I read the market to know what direction to march in and then rally all the troops and keep a
                smile on their face. Check out my projects or reach out.</p>
